# Sliceria 🍕

Sliceria is a static website for a pizzeria business, built with modern web technologies to provide a seamless user experience.

**Tech used:**

React – For building the user interface
TypeScript – For type safety and maintainability
Tailwind CSS – For styling and responsive design
Tanstack Router - For routing
Firebase – For contact form

**Things I learned:**

I realized that Tailwind CSS can get bloated, especially in larger projects. Debugging styles is also much harder even with my own after some time. Next time, I'll create custom classes alongside Tailwind for better maintainability.

For deployment and routing, I ran into issues with my base route and had to troubleshoot.I also didn’t consider that GitHub Pages serves the site under user/project-name, which required me to reroute my paths.I did hard code the paths as a quick fix but next time, I'll create an .env file to keep things flexible and avoid manual adjustments.

**Getting Started**

```
git clone
cd sliceria
npm run dev
```

Enjoy your slice of the web with Sliceria! 🍕
